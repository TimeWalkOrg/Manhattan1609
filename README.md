# Manhattan 1609
An historically accurate reconstruction of Manhattan (and nearby shorelines) as of Henry Hudson's 1609 arrival

- Built in Unreal Engine 5.2.  Will run on desktop PCs, Macs -- eventually mobile, VR, and AR devices
- Inspired by the awesome [Manahatta Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannahatta_Project) (aka [Welikia](https://welikia.org/))
- As part of the larger [TimeWalk.org](https://github.com/TimeWalkOrg) project, this model will eventually incorporate terrain and building models for 1660, 1776, 1882, and 2023 (enabling virtual "time travel")
- An open-source project: contact us to contribute!
